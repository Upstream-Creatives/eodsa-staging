## 🎓 Best Practices for Virtual Judging

### Before Scoring:

1. **Watch Complete Performance**
   - Don't score while watching first time
   - Focus on overall impression

2. **Rewatch for Specific Criteria**
   - Technical: Rewatch for execution details
   - Musical: Listen to rhythm and timing
   - Performance: Look for expression and energy
   - Styling: Notice costume, presentation
   - Overall: Final impression after all reviews

3. **Take Notes (Optional)**
   - Pause video to write observations
   - Use comments field for feedback
   - Note timestamps if helpful

### During Scoring:

4. **Score Each Category Independently**
   - Don't let one category influence others
   - Use full range (0-20) appropriately
   - Be consistent across performances

5. **Use Video Controls**
   - Rewind to verify specific moves
   - Slow down (0.5x speed in settings) for technical review
   - Pause on key moments

6. **Be Thorough**
   - Better to watch twice than score incorrectly
   - Virtual judging allows multiple reviews - use this advantage

### After Scoring:

7. **Review Before Submit**
   - Check all scores are entered
   - Verify no typos or mistakes
   - Read comments for clarity

8. **Cannot Edit After Submit**
   - Scores are final once submitted
   - Contact admin if correction needed
   - Take time to be accurate
